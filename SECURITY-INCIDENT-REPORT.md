# MongoDB URI Security Incident Report

## Incident Summary

**Date:** July 6, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** RESOLVED

### What Happened

Multiple script files in the repository contained hardcoded MongoDB connection strings with sensitive credentials, including:

- MongoDB Atlas username: `helizakay1`
- MongoDB Atlas password: `Lsdfdslfkj-900-90-`
- Database connection details

### Affected Files

The following files contained hardcoded credentials:

- `scripts/check-production-data.js`
- `scripts/check-reviews-detailed.js`
- `scripts/list-collections.js`
- `scripts/add-test-reviews.js`
- `scripts/test-homepage-queries.js`
- `scripts/check-dev-data.js`

### Resolution Actions Taken

#### 1. âœ… Code Remediation

- Removed all hardcoded MongoDB URIs from scripts
- Replaced with environment variable usage (`process.env.MONGODB_URI`)
- Added validation to ensure environment variables are set
- Added `dotenv` configuration for proper environment variable loading

#### 2. âœ… Security Documentation

- Created `SECURITY.md` with security guidelines
- Documented proper environment variable usage
- Added incident response procedures

#### 3. âœ… Repository Cleanup

- Committed security fixes with detailed commit message
- Pushed fixed version to GitHub (commit: a070658)

### CRITICAL ACTIONS STILL REQUIRED

#### ðŸš¨ 1. IMMEDIATE: Rotate MongoDB Credentials

**This is the most critical action - must be done immediately:**

1. **Login to MongoDB Atlas**: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. **Navigate to Database Access** under Security
3. **Delete or disable the exposed user**: `helizakay1`
4. **Create a new database user** with strong, unique credentials
5. **Update the connection string** in your `.env.local` file
6. **Test the connection** to ensure it works

#### ðŸš¨ 2. URGENT: Clean Git History (Optional but Recommended)

The exposed credentials still exist in git history. Consider:

- Using `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove sensitive data
- Force pushing the cleaned history
- Informing team members to re-clone the repository

#### 3. Review and Monitor

- Monitor MongoDB Atlas logs for any suspicious activity
- Check if there were any unauthorized access attempts
- Review other repositories for similar security issues

### Prevention Measures

1. **Never commit sensitive data** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all secrets
3. **Regular security audits** of codebase
4. **Pre-commit hooks** to detect sensitive data
5. **Team training** on secure coding practices

### Timeline

- **Initial exposure**: When scripts were first committed (commit fb05980)
- **GitHub alert**: July 6, 2025
- **Detection**: July 6, 2025
- **Resolution**: July 6, 2025 (commit a070658)
- **Credential rotation**: PENDING - MUST BE DONE IMMEDIATELY

### Impact Assessment

- **Exposure duration**: From initial commit until now
- **Affected systems**: MongoDB Atlas database
- **Data at risk**: Application database content
- **Users affected**: All application users potentially

## NEXT STEPS CHECKLIST

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Rotate MongoDB credentials immediately
- [ ] **HIGH**: Review MongoDB Atlas access logs
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Consider cleaning git history
- [ ] **LOW**: Implement pre-commit hooks for security scanning
- [ ] **LOW**: Train team on secure coding practices

**Contact**: If you need help with any of these steps, please reach out immediately.
